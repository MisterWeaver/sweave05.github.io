      My name is Samuel Weaver. I was born in 1998 to a family of
      three but now have three siblings. In my immediate family, I have my mother, father, older
      brother, and two youngers brothers. We have only lived in Middlesex County in Massachusetts
      my entire life.

      My mother's family is full of engineers and I initially wanted to pursue mechanical
      engineering as a career. However, during my senior year of highschool, my passion for computer
      science grew stronger. Accordingly, when I got to college, I decided to pursue computer
      science. During my freshman year of college, I realized that my long standing passion for
      finance, which was sparked by reading personal finance books, could lead to a career as well.
      Since then, I have decided to pursue a career in finance while focusing on how computers may
      be used to realize higher gains and increase worker efficiency.
