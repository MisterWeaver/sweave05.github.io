COMP 20 - Lab 4: Your Portfolio

My website has three pages: the index (homepage), biography page, and resume page.
The homepage is very basic.
The biography accurately describes my life but leaves out specific details and does not cover
    my entire life.
The resume, with the exception of the Relevant Coursework section, presents a subset of the
    information present on my actual resume.

All aspects of the required work have been correctly implemented.

I did not collaborate not did I discuss this assignment with anyone.

I spent roughly six hours on this assignment.
